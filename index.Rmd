# **Pollution & Prejudice Collaboration and Data Community**

<!--- ### *Resource Repository* {style="padding-top: 0px;"} --->
Welcome to the Pollution & Prejudice Collaboration & Data Community! We are a group of environmental professionals who use the best available data to explore and validate community experiences of environmental injustice. We envision this community to be an open research space investigating the data informing racial equity and environmental justice questions and solution. Our goals include:

1.	Cultivating inclusive collaboration among groups interested in the intersection of data science & environmental justice
2.	Building online tools for the visualization & communication of environmental justice stories
3.	Transparent sharing of data analysis processes, which enables the reproducibility of group findings
4.	Serving as a data hub for environmental justice datasets


This site is currently maintained by the CalEPA racial equity data workgroup and is a work in progress. Additional content will be added as our community develops. If you'd like to suggest a resource to add, please send a message to <waterdata@waterboards.ca.gov>.
