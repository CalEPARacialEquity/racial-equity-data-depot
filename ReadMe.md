## CalEPA Racial Equity and Environmental Justice Resources Repository
This repository contains the documents that build an R-Markdown based website. The site is a catalog of some resources related to racial equity and environmental justice, including some which the [California Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.calepa.ca.gov/) and our partners have developed, as well as some resources developed by other individuals and orgizations which we have found to be helpful in or work. The site is a work in progress.

The site is available at: https://CalEPARacialEquity.github.io/racial-equity-data-depot/
